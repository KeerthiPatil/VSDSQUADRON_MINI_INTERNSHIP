**RISC-V Instruction Format**  
RISC-V is a modern, open-source RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) instruction set architecture (ISA) that is designed to be simple, extensible, and suitable for a wide range of applications. The RISC-V ISA defines 6 standard instruction formats, these formats are:  
**1.	R-type  
2.	I-type  
3.	S-type  
4.	B-type   
5.	U-type  
6.	J-type**

Few immediate observations we can make about these core formats:  
1.By convention, RISC-V instructions are each 1 word = 4 bytes = 32 bits i.e. fixed-length encoding  
2.They all reserve the first 7 bits ([6:0]) for the opcode.  
3.Register-based operations.
