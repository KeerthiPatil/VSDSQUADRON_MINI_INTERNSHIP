**RISC-V Instruction Format**  
RISC-V is a modern, open-source RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) instruction set architecture (ISA) that is designed to be simple, extensible, and suitable for a wide range of applications. The RISC-V ISA defines 6 standard instruction formats, these formats are:  
**1.	R-type  
2.	I-type
