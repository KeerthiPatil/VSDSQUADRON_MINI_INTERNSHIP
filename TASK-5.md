# Conducting a Functional Simulation Experiment with RISC-V Core : `Verilog Netlist` and `Testbench`, and Observing Waveform  

> * To perform functional simulation of RISC-V on Ubuntu running in a virtual machine, we need to ensure that Verilog and GTKWave are installed, which is already performed in TASK-1
