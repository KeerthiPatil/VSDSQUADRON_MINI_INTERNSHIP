# Conducting a Functional Simulation Experiment with RISC-V Core : `Verilog Netlist` and `Testbench`, and Observing Waveform  

> * To perform functional simulation of RISC-V on Ubuntu running in a virtual machine, we need to ensure that Verilog and GTKWave are installed, which is already performed in  <a href="https://github.com/KeerthiPatil/VSDSQUADRON_MINI_INTERNSHIP/blob/521f141724596c3a0b9e766b10dd59874f90fe80/TASK-1.md">Task-1</a>
