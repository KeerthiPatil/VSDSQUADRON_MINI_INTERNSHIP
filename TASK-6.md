# Implementation of `2-bit Comparator` using VSDSquadron Mini Board:
###  Overview:  
This project aims to design and implement a 2-bit comparator using the VSDSquadron Mini board. A 2-bit comparator is a digital circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers and indicates whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. The project involves designing the comparator logic using C programming in Visual Studio Code, setting up the hardware connections on a breadboard, and verifying the functionality through LEDs connected to the output.  

###  Project Objective:    
The objective of this project is to:

1 .Design a 2-bit comparator using C programming.
2. Implement the designed comparator on the VSDSquadron Mini board.
3. Verify the correct functionality of the comparator by using LEDs to display the comparison results.
4. Gain hands-on experience in digital circuit design, C programming, and hardware implementation.
